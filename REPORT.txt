- Write a program that takes about 60 seconds to run in your interpreter
  then run the compiled version and measure its execution time.

  * What is the runtime for both versions?
  * Try to explain the difference

  The interpreter took around 55 seconds to run while the compiled version took 590 milliseconds to run.

- Why is it a good idea to "mov $0,%rax" before calling printf?

- Why does my implementation of p3.c use the "-static" gcc flag? Do your best
  to explain the reason. Try to remove the flag and see the what happens
